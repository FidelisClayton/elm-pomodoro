> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros.

This Pomodoro app has 3 modes, **Work**, **Social** and **Coffee** which has 25 minutes, 5 minutes and 15 minutes respectively.
